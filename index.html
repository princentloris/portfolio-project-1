      Welcome to Romu's world
     </h2>
     <p>
      Once upon a time, in a city stitched together by cobblestone streets and neon lights, there lived a curious soul named Romu. Romu wasn’t your ordinary guy—no, he had a knack for seeing magic tucked inside the everyday. Where others saw a crowded café, Romu saw a symphony of stories waiting to be heard. Where others saw a rainstorm, he saw poetry splashing against the sidewalks.
      One evening, while sipping the strongest coffee the city had to offer, Romu had a realization:</p>
     <b>Why keep all these adventures to myself?</b>
     <br>
     Thus, this blog was born—a little corner of the internet where curiosity leads, creativity blooms, and every visitor becomes part of the journey.
     Here, you’ll find musings, stories, wild ideas, and a few surprises (Romu loves a good surprise). Whether you're here for a quick read, a deep conversation, or just a spark of inspiration, Romu’s got a seat saved for you.</p>

          <p>Romu loves Paris-Brest pastries for their perfect balance of light choux and rich praline cream. To him, each bite feels like a small celebration — a reminder that life’s sweetest moments are often the simplest.</p>

          <p>Romu’s cat, Gypsy, is irresistibly cute but incredibly needy. She’ll follow him around the house, pawing at his legs for attention, then demand cuddles at the most inconvenient times. Her charm? Undeniable. Her constant neediness? Absolutely impossible to ignore.</p>
